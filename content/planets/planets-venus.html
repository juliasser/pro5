        <h3>The hottest planet around!</h3>
        <h2>Can you<br/>resist<br/><span class="planet">Venus</span>?</h2>
        <p>The Morning Star, the Evening Star. Because of its pretty much similiar size and mass, Venus is often called »The Sister Planet of Earth«. It is also the second brightest object in our night sky, right after the Moon. But is Venus the good or bad sibling? We'll find out! Descend through the layer of deadly clouds and prepare for landing.</p>

        <h3>Wait a minute. Deadly clouds?!</h3>
        <p>Exactly. Venus is covered with a layer of clouds made of sulphuric acid. One might think that after landig and surviving deadly acid, anything that will follow can't be that bad. That's when Earth's angry sister proves you wrong. After being crushed by the atmospheric pressure, which is juuust slighty (92 times!) greater than Earth's, you get burnt up. An average surface temperature of 462°C makes life as we know it impossible.</p>
        <p>You definitely have enough time to throughoutly enjoy your suffering, since a Venus-Day takes 117 Earth Days.</p>

        <h3>Exploration?</h3>
        <p>Humans have actually managed to send various probes to Venus. Some of them orbit the planet, but a few actually attempted to land. The VENERA landers, sent oud by the USSR, even managed to send photographs of the surface back to Earth.</p>
