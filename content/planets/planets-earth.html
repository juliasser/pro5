        <h3>Welcome back!</h3>
        <h2>Water, Life?<br />All here<br />on <span class="planet">Earth</span>.</h2>
        <p>Welcome to The Blue Planet. Earth is the only known body in the whole Universe to harbour life as we know it. All human history, all your friends, life, death and the troubles of getting up early in the morning are all contained on this pretty small rock floating through time and space. Pretty scary, right? Don't worry, there are lots of beautiful things to enjoy around here. Come take a look!</p>

        <h3>To put things in perspective…</h3>
        <p>Earth is not only the largest of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System, it is also the densest one. About 71% of its surface is covered with liquid water. Those huge oceans are where life started within the first billion years of earth's history. Earth has a solid inner iron core and a liquit outer core, which makes for a pretty strong magnetic field and plate tectonics.</p>

        <h3>You're not alone!</h3>
        <p>Earth is the only planet thriving with life. Altough about 99% of all species which have ever existed are instinct by now, there are still too much species to even estimate. Over 7.4 billion humans are currently inhabitating Earth, forming diverse societies and being fully dependant on the planet's biosphere.</p>
        <p>It hasn't ever been that way, though. About four billion years ago, chemical reactions resulted in the first single celled life forms living in the Earth's oceans, which developed into more complex multicellular life forms. Evolution did its thing and the first animals started roaming the continents. Eventually, this led to life as we know it today.</p>

        <h3>The Moon</h3>
        <p>Earth has a companion! The Moon, its natural sattelite, was most likely formed by a huge collision with a Mars-sized protoplanet, impacts Earth's climate and prevents its rotational axis from being completely chaotic. There are lunar phases which are caused by the illumination of the Moon by the Sun. The Moon is the only object in the Solar System which astronauts have ever visited.</p>
