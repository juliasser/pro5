        <h3>The Giant of the Solar System</h3>
        <h2>The<br />massive<br /><span class="planet">Jupiter</span>.</h2>
        <p>So, you've found Jupiter. Compared to all the other planets, it's definitely a lot less likely to be missed. Its size is really intimidating: Jupiter is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the whole Solar System — combined. It's classified as a Gas Giant, since it consists mainly of (suprise!) gases. You should definitely come check this one out!</p>

        <h3>The Great Red Spot</h3>
        <p>Besides its size, the most distinct feature about Jupiter is the massive storm which has been raging on its surface for over 400 years. Winds can reach speeds of over 400km per hour, making it the most violent storm in the whole Solar System. And its huuuge – three Earths could fit inside the storm's area..</p>

        <h3>The Jovenian Satellites</h3>
        <p>Jupiter actually has a small ring system. It's not nearly as prominent as the ring system of Saturn, but nonetheless it stretches far out more than 225,000 km into the Universe.</p>
        <p>The moons of Jupiter are called the Jovian satellites. There are 67 of them, containing the largest moon in our Solar System, Ganymede, which is larger than Mercury. The most interesting one might be Europa, which is coated with a thick layer of water ice. Scientists think that there might be a huge water ocean underneath, which could possibly harbour life. </p>
