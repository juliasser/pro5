        <h3>Wohoo! First Planet!</h3>
        <h2>You've<br />reached<br /><span class="planet">Mercury</span>.</h2>
        <p>That's not our Moon, even if both look the same at the first glance. Welcome to the smallest planet of our solar system! We hope you did bring sunscreen, since it can get as hot as 427°C around here. Prefer the cold? Come to the dark side, there's a minimum of -173°C to easily freeze to death. Nice, right?</p>

        <h3>Surface</h3>
        <p>So, you've touched down on Mercury. Now what do you see? First of all, there are lots of craters, left behind by meteorites which hit the planet in the last several million years. You've guessed correctly: There's no life here, no plants and oceans, there even aren't any vulcanoes or an atmosphere. Winds, rain or other activity is unknown here. Mercury is pretty much dead — but pretty interesting, nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Sorry to disappoint you: You're not the first explorer to visit Mercury. In fact, you only won third place. Up until now, <b>NASA</b> has sent two probes to our Solar System's innermost planet, one being <strong>MARINER 10</strong> in 1975 and the other one being <strong>MESSENGER</strong> in 2008. Mercury is actually pretty hard to aim for, since it's <em>that</em> close to the sun. You can visit it on your own though: It's one of the 5 planets which are visibile with the naked eye.</p>

        <h3>Beautiful, isn't it?</h3>
        <p>Well, let's just say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Mercury takes the questionable cake as the most cratered planet in the whole Solar System. Since there are no geological processes, most of its various encounters with small and pretty huge enemies (aka meteorites) are still visible today.</p>
        <p>If we dig a bit deeper, it's all tough on the outside but soft on the inside. Mercury most likely — according to NASA — has a molten core. This is unusual for smaller planets, since their cores cool down pretty fast. What it doesn't have though is an atmosphere. But who needs one, anyway.</p>
        <p>By the way, talking about beauty: Don't feel bad about the last 10 slices of Pizza you just ate: Your Mercury-Weight would only be about 38% of your Earth-Weight anyway.</p>
