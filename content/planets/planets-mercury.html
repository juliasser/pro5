        <p>That's not our Moon, even if both look the same at the first glance. Welcome to the smallest planet of our solar system! We hope you did bring sunscreen, since it can get as hot as 427°C around here. Prefer the cold? Come to the dark side, there's a minimum of -173°C to easily freeze to death. Nice, right?</p>

        <h3>Surface</h3>
        <p>So, you've touched down on Mercury. Now what do you see? First of all, there are lots of craters, left behind by meteorites which hit the planet in the last several million years. You've guessed correctly: There's no life here, no plants and oceans, there even aren't any vulcanoes or an atmosphere. Winds, rain or other activity is unknown here. Mercury is pretty much dead — but pretty interesting, nonetheless.</p>
