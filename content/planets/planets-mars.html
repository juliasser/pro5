        <h3>The God of War</h3>
        <h2>Say<br />hi to<br /><span class="planet">Mars</span>.</h2>
        <p>Finally, you've reached the "Red Planet". Mars, our direct neighbor, has sparked the imagination of storytellers and writers all throughout history. It is pretty similiar when compared to Earth, with mountains and deserts, dead vulcanoes and canyons. Can you live on the Red Planet? Has there ever been life around here? We'll find out. Let's find a safe landing spot and prepare for contact.</p>

        <h3>Is it really red?</h3>
        <p>You've reached the surface, and what do you know? Mars actually looks like it's full of rust. They haven't made this up: Mars' red color is caused by dust made of iron oxide, so it actually is the same stuff you can find on any rusty nail here on Earth. So basically, Mars looks like a huge desert full of rocks, dust and dunes.</p>

        <h3>What about water and life?</h3>
        <p>Life — as we know it — would be pretty difficult to evolve around here. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Surprisingly, Mars shows signs of liquid water which was present in the past, and maybe even still is there today, of course in much smaller amounts. Some scientists are pretty convinced that mars has been really active in the past, even partly covered in oceans. The thick ice layer at the poles is also made partly of water. It's mostly made up from carbon dioxide though.</p>
        <p>All in all, we can't really rule out the possibility of reeeeeally small life forms having been there in the past or even as we speak, which is pretty interesting!</p>

        <h3>Olympus Mons</h3>
        <p>It's not all about the size — seems like Mars didn't get the memo. Our neighboring planet hosts the largest mountain (actually, it's a vulcano) in the whole Solar System. Olympus Mons, a shield vulcano, is about 21km high and 600km in diameter.</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, it shows signs of volcanic lava flows which has scientists believe it could still be active.</p>

        <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <p>It's a pretty sealed deal that Mars might be the next extraterrestial object visited by astronauts form Earth. Until this happens, we have to rely on data provided by Mars orbiters and probes, of which over 30 were launched in the past decades. Sadly enough, only about half of them actually reached their target without breaking or impacting at full force.</p>

        <p>Currently, there are two active rovers — Curiosity and Opportunity, both launched by NASA — driving around on Mars. </p>
