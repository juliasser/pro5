        <h3>Alright. Bad Jokes Ahead!</h3>
        <h2>Ice Ice, <br/>Baby! <span class="planet">Uranus</span>!</h2>
        <p>It's pretty cold around here. Remember when you were getting burnt up by the heat of the sun? You'll miss those times. We hope you brought gloves. Crank the heated seats in your spaceship up to the max and approach the icy landscapes of Uranus. Here we go!</p>

        <h3>Ice all over!</h3>
        <p>Uranus is pretty similiar to Neptune. Both being two of the four gas giants in our solar system, they're both ice giants because of their special primary composition, containing more "ices" like water, ammonia and methane.</p>
        <p>That's right: Uranus is basically rocks and ices, layered with even more ice, additionally winning first place in the "how cold can it get"-contest of the solar system. Its atmosphere takes the cake as the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system, with a minimum temperature of -224.2°C. That's pretty cold, right?</p>

        <h3>It's huge!</h3>
        <p>Uranus is the third largest planet in the whole solar system — the earth would fit inside the gas giant about 64 times.</p>

        <h3>Ring system</h3>
        <p>Even though it's not as distinctive as Saturn's, Uranus has a ring system which is actually quite similiar. In 1977, the ring system was accidentally discovered and first imaged by VOYAGER 2 in 1986.</p>
